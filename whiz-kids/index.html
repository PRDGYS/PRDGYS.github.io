      Our core team has various strengths, but we all have
      some sort of technical background. We prefer technical
      people in every position, however, for artistic positions 
      we do not care.

      Here are our open positions:
      <ul>
        <li>3D Asset Artists (Proficient in Blender)</li>
        <li>Cybersecurity focused developer</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    If you're interesed in one of these positions, email 
    seun.omonije@yale.edu with the subject line 
    "Whiz Kids Interest", a resume, and a short description
    about your interests (1-3 sentences).
